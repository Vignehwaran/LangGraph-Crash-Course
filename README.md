# 🌐 LangGraph Crash Course

![LangGraph Banner](langgraph_banner.png)

Welcome to the **LangGraph Crash Course** – a hands-on, beginner-friendly guide to building stateful, multi-agent applications using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph). This course will walk you through the fundamental concepts of LangGraph and help you build real-world AI workflows with ease.

---

## 📦 What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a powerful Python framework that combines LangChain with **state machines** and **graphs** to manage AI agent workflows. Perfect for building:
- Autonomous agents
- Human-in-the-loop systems
- Multi-step reasoning flows
- Research assistants & more!
